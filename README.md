ocua-parity-league
==================

A collection of examples, scripts and apps that I've wrote for playing with the data from the [OCUA Parity Ultimate League](http://www.ocua.ca/Winter-Parity). Each sub-directory contains another README explaining what the code does, where it is running and how to use it.

Weekly data is stored on Google Drive
